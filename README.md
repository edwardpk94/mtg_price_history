(WIP - analysis not complete)

Analysis of Magic: The Gathering price histories per set; when is the best time to buy cards after a set comes out?

To answer this question I scrapped price history data for a variety of magic sets from [MTGGoldfish.com](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/). Although this site offers a premium subscription, I decided using web scrapping to acquire the time series data would be more interesting!

Some examples:
